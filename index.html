        <h2>Places I Need To Visit!</h2>
        <p>This is a small but fun website I had fun coding in under 15 minutes. It is a simple design but I really wanted to try my had on some parallax scrolling feature for each of the pictures. The original tutorial for this project is located <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYceq2HGJ84" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> if anyone is intrested. This project uses HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript and I also used simplePARALLAX.js library for the scroll effects in the pictures.</p>

        <h2>CHICAGO</h2>
    </div>
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li>The name Chicago was first recorded in 1688, where it appears as Chigagou,  an Algonquian word meaning “onion field.”</li>
            <li>Chicago’s first permanent settler in 1779 was Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a trapper and merchant credited with building the trading post that evolved into Chicago. With French and African parentage, du Sable hailed from Haiti and settled in what was to become Chicago with his Potawatomi wife, Kittihawa (Catherine).</li>
            <li>Chicago was incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city in 1837.</li>
            <li>The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed one-third of the city and left more than 100,000 homeless. Its initial spark remains unknown. FYI: The Chicago Water Tower and Pumping Station on Michigan Avenue, now home to City Gallery and Lookingglass Theatre, are among Chicago’s few remaining pre-fire buildings.</li>
            <li>The 1893 Columbian Exposition was held on the grounds of Chicago’s Jackson Park. The exposition buildings were so striking that they launched the so-called ‘City Beautiful’ movement, which focused on Beaux-Arts aesthetics in American city planning. FYI: The exposition also gave rise to Chicago’s nickname, “The White City,” due to the appearance of its massive white Beaux-Arts-inspired edifices.</li>
            <li>In 1900, Chicago successfully completed a massive and highly innovative engineering project, reversing the flow of the Chicago River so that it would empty into the Mississippi River rather than Lake Michigan.</li> 
            <li>FYI: Each year, the Chicago River is dyed green to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day.</li>
